### A Sieve algorithm, specifically the Sieve of Eratosthenes, is a popular and efficient method used to find all prime numbers up to a given limit. It is named after the ancient Greek mathematician Eratosthenes, who developed the algorithm.

In this chapter, we will  be learning about:

- Sieve of Eratosthenes
- Bitwise Sieve
- Prime Factorization using Sieve
- Segmented Sieve
- Sieve of Sundaram
