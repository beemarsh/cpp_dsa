# Bit Manipulation

An algorithmic operation known as **bit manipulation** involves the manipulation of bits at the bit level (bitwise). Bit manipulation is all about these bitwise operations. They improve the efficiency of programs by being primitive, fast actions.

## Basic Understanding of how C++ compilers assign bits to memory

There are different data types that occupy different size of memory.
