# Bit Manipulation

An algorithmic operation known as **bit manipulation** involves the manipulation of bits at the bit level (bitwise). Bit manipulation is all about these bitwise operations. They improve the efficiency of programs by being primitive, fast actions.

## Basic Understanding of how C++ compilers assign bits to memory

There are different data types that occupy different size of memory.

The following diagram shows 8 bits (1 byte) memory.

    B --- C[Bit 5]
    C --- D[Bit 4]
    D --- E[Bit 3]
    E --- F[Bit 2]
    F --- G[Bit 1]
    G --- H[Bit 0]
