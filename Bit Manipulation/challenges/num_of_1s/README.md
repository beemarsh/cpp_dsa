# Find numbers of Set Bits

## Example:

Lets say we have to find the number of 1s in `5`.

The binary equivalent of `5` is `101`.

So, the number of set bits is : `2`.

## Brian Kernighanâ€™s Algorithm

Subtracting 1 from a decimal number flips all the bits after the rightmost set bit(which is 1) including the rightmost set bit.

For example :

- 10 in binary is 00001010  
- 9 in binary is 00001001  
- 8 in binary is 00001000  
- 7 in binary is 00000111  

So if we subtract a number by `1` and do it bitwise `&` with itself `(n & (n-1))`, we unset the rightmost set bit.

If we do n & (n-1) in a loop and count the number of times the loop executes, we get the set bit count. 
The beauty of this solution is the number of times it loops is equal to the number of set bits in a given integer.
