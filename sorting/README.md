# Sorting
### Sorting means arranging the elements in a certain order. In this chapter, we will be sorting numbers in an array in an ascending order.

There are different sorting methods.
- Selection Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort

## Selection Sort
In a selection sort, we find the minimum element in the array and swap it with the current element.
Let an array **a** of size **n**
Let **a[7] = {8,3,66,24,1,9,21}**

We have to use two loops.
First traverse from **0** to **n-2** and in the inner loop traverse from **1 to n-1**
