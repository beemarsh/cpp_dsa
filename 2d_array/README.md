# 2D Array

2D arrays are similar to two dimensional matrix.

The following is a 3 * 4 matrix.

|    |  0 |  1 |  2 |  3 |
|----|---:|---:|---:|---:|
|  **0** |  2 |  4 |  1 | 2 |
|  **1** |  8 |  4 |  3 | 6 |
|  **2** |  1 |  7 |  9 | 5 |

The above matrix can be declared as:

`int arr[3][4]`


## Declaration of 2D arrays

2D Arrays are declared similar to 1D arrays but with an additional dimension.

Syntax: 
```cpp
int arr[rows][columns]`
```

For example:

```cpp
int arr[m][n];
char arr[m][n];
float arr[m][n];
bool arr[m][n];
```
