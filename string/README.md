# Strings

To use strings in a program, you need to include a header called string.
## Declaring a string
```cpp
string str = "word";
```

We can also specify the size of the string.

```cpp
string str(10);
```

We can also fill the string with certain characters.

```cpp
string str(5,"N");
```

We can also make copy of the string.
