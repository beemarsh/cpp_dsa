# Sub array

Sub-array is a continuous part of an array

Let an array **a** of size **n**
Let **a[7] = {8,3,66,24,1,9,21}**
For example: **{8,3,66}**, **{1,9}**, **{21}**, **{66}**, **{24,1,9}**
Number of sub arrays in an array of size **n** is $\frac{n  *  (n + 1)}{2}$

# Sub Sequence

Sub sequence is a sequence that can derived from an array by selecting zero or more elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

Let an array **a** of size **n**
Let **a[7] = {8,3,66,24,1,9,21}**
For example: **{8,66}**, **{1,9,21}**, **{21}**, **{66,1,21}**, **{8,21}**
Number of sub sequence in an array of size **n** is $2^{n}$
